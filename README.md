# FarmaPRED-PEP: Early Onset Response (EOR) Predictor

This application allows clinicians and researchers to estimate the probability of early onset response (EOR) to antipsychotic treatment in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP). The data used to develop this model was the PEPS cohort from the study “Genotype-Phenotype Interaction and Environment. Application to a Predictive Model in First Psychotic Episodes” (PI08/0208), which can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2012.11.001 .
